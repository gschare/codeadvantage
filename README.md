# Hey class!
This is a GitHub Repository, a place where programmers upload and share their code.

I'm using it to allow you to access code we did in class.

# To get code we did in class:
1. Go to your section folder. "Morning Python" is the 11:30-12:30 session and "Afternoon Python" is the 2:00-3:00 session. GameQuest is GameQuest.
2. Find the file you need and click on it.
3. Near the top of the file, find the "Raw" button and click it. You should now see just the code.
4. Select the entire code and copy-paste it into your editor window.
5. Save!

# Class progression:
1. Python Level 1
2. Python Level 2
3. Python Level 3
4. Game Quest
5. Animal Expedition (starting in the fall)
