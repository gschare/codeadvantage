# Hey class!
This is a GitHub Repository, a place where programmers upload and share their code.

I'm using it to allow you to access code we did in class.

# To get code we did in class:
1. Go to your section folder. "Morning Python" is the 11:30-12:30 session and "Afternoon Python" is the 2:00-3:00 session.
2. Find the file you need and click on it.
3. Near the top of the file, find the "Raw" button and click it. You should now see just the code.
4. Select the entire code and copy-paste it into the IDLE editor window.
5. Save!

# What to take after Python Level 3:
- Python Game Quest (taught by me, starting August 10th, same time)
- Animal Expedition (following Game Quest in the fall)
