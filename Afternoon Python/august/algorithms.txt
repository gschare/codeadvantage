 - way to solve something like a puzzle
 - specifying/explaining something

algorithm (officially):
 - set of instructions to reach a desired result

requirements to be an algorithm:
 1. clear
 2. have a stopping point
 3. computable: able to perform the task

"algorithm" comes from Muhummad ibn Musa Al-Khwarizmi, he was a Persian mathematician

also invented "algebra"

addition algorithm:
 1. give two numbers
 2. put them on top of each other
 3. add columns from right to left
 4. result is your answer


Pseudocode:
- description of the steps of an algorithm as specifically and clearly as possible
