Algorithm: "set of instructions to reach a desired result"

Muhammad ibn Musa Al-Khwarizmi -- Persian mathematician

How to shampoo your hair:
1. Wet hair
2. Rinse
	rinse what?
	rinse for how long?
3. Lather
	lather what?
	lather for how long?
4. Repeat
	repeat what?
	repeat(1-4)
	how many times should I repeat it?
5. Stop.
Output: clean hair

Algorithms MUST be:
	1. unambiguous
	2. stopping point

A better algorithm:
	1. Wet(hair)
	2. Rinse(hair) until entirely wet
	3. Lather(hair) for 30 seconds
	4. Repeat(all steps) 3 times

pseudocode

syntax error: rules "grammar" of Python
runtime error: Python runs the file but encounters something it doesn't understand or breaks the rules
logic error: your program doesn't do what you want it to do

Logic error in shampoo algorithm:
	1. Wet hair
	2. Rinse
	3. Repeat
Logic error:
	- perfect grammar
	- runs the file
	- doesn't achieve what I was hoping
